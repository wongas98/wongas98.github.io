					<h2>Room For Squares</h2>
					<h4>2001</h4>
					<p><strong><big>(8/10)</big></strong> Mayer's debut album established himself both as a talented vocalist and guitarist. From his soft voice in "Back to You", to his soulful guitar solos in "City Love" and "83", it is no wonder that <i>Room For Squares</i> produced acoustic pop rock hits like "Your Body Is a Wonderland" and "Neon". </p><br>
					<p><i>Recommended: "My Stupid Mouth", "Great Indoors"</i></p>

				<h2>Heavier Things</h2>
				<h4>2003</h4>
				<p><strong><big>(7/10)</big></strong> While this album does not live up to his debut album, <i>Heavier Things</i> is still a quality album, especially for those who love old John Mayer. This album shifted away from the relative safety of pop rock, revealing more of Mayer's blues and folk influences with songs like, "Clarity" and "Come Back to Bed". Not to mention the catchy intro riff in "Something's Missing", which amazes me every single time, and the smash hit, "Daughters", which has become a John Mayer classic. </p><br>
				<p><i>Recommended: "Daughters", "Something's Missing"</i></p>

				<h2>Continuum</h2>
				<h4>2006</h4>
				<p><strong><big>(9.5/10)</big></strong> <i>Continuum</i> is undoubtedly John Mayer's best studio album, fully featuring his undeniable talent as a vocalist and guitarist. It is rare that I genuinely love every single song on an album. This album is one of the few exceptions. Deviating even further from his prior albums, Mayer's blues and jazz influences are on full display. Those influences combined with his acoustic style is what makes this album so great.</p><br>
				<p><i>Recommended: "Gravity", "I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You)", "Slow Dancing in a Burning Room"</i></p>

				<h2>Where the Light Is</h2>
				<h4>2008</h4>
				<p><strong><big>(10/10)</big></strong> While <i>Continuum</i> is John Mayer's best studio album, <i>Where the Light Is</i> is his best album ever, and my favorite album of all-time. There is just nothing compared to hearing John Mayer perform live. Featuring exclusive covers of "In Your Atmosphere" and "Free Fallin'", the greatness of this album can not be understated. After listening to countless hours of John Mayer live and seeing him perform live in concert, I can easily say that this album is a magnificent, one-of-a-kind experience.</p><br>
				<p><i>Recommended: THE ENTIRE ALBUM (but especially "Gravity" - my favorite song on the album)</i></p>

				<h2>Battle Studies</h2>
				<h4>2009</h4>
				<p><strong><big>8/10</big></strong> This album is reminiscent of the rock songs found in <i>Room for Squares</i> and <i>Heavier Things</i>. Featuring more distorted electric guitar in songs like "Friends, Lovers, or Nothing" and "Crossroads", this album is certainly more rock influenced. That being said, this album also features more prominent country and folk influences, especially in songs like "Half of My Heart" and "Who Says". Overall, this is a quality album with hits like "Heartbreak Warfare" along with more experimental songs like "Assassin".</p><br>
				<p><i>Recommended: "Edge of Desire", "Perfectly Lonely"</i></p>

				<h2>Born and Raised</h2>
				<h4>2012</h4>
				<p><strong><big>(4/10)</big></strong> To be completely honest, it wasn't until recently that I actually gave this album a chance following all of the negative reviews surrounding it. The folk/country sound and lack of crazy guitar riffs and solos just did not resonate with what I'd grown to love about John Mayer and his music. Even though I am a diehard fan of "old" John Mayer, after giving this album a listen, I was able to find a few quality songs.</p><br>

				<h2>Paradise Valley</h2>
				<h4>2013</h4>
				<p><strong><big>(3/10)</big></strong> Country and folk music are simply not what John Mayer is best at. This album lacks any standout songs and doesn't evoke John Mayer much at all. Granted, his vocal cords were damaged around this time, but still. </p><br>
				<p><i>Recommended: "Who You Love"</i></p>

				<h2>The Search for Everything</h2>
				<h4>2017</h4>
				<p><strong><big>(7.5/10)</big></strong> After two albums exploring his folk and country side, this album draws from pop rock influences from his early albums and adds some funk to it. This new funky style from John Mayer initially threw me off, but this album executes this style quite well. "Love on the Weekend" and "In the Blood" are relatively safe pop rock songs with mild funk influence, whereas "Still Feel Like Your Man" and "Moving On and Getting Over" are strongly influenced by funk. Overall, a solid album, but did not live up to the hype.</p><br>
				<p><i>Recommended: "Moving On and Getting Over", "Rosie"</i></p>
